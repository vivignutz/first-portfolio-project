"Na gringa" means "abroad" in Brazilian slang, and it comes from "gringo", which the word that the Mexicans give to those Yankee imperialists who went to war and took their land. For Brazilians, "gringo" is a common way to refer to people from other countries, and not always used in a pejorative way.

# <PodNagringa_Podcast>

## Description

For the first milestone task with Code Institute, I created a one-page website that features the "NaGringa Podcast", an actual podcast project that will go live later in 2022. 

The goal of the website is to present a first impression of the NaGringa Podcast project, informing its mission, who is behind the work, its social networks and also a contact form for potential interested parties.

My motivation for this project was to start the branding process of PodNagringa Podcast, given that it is a real project that is being developed by me right now. 

The PodNagringa Podcast aims to supply the lack of information regarding bureaucracy, housing, health, etc, that Brazilians immigrants in Europe face, with tips coming from the guests, also Brazilians, who already live in Europe and are on tour in Berlin, where the episodes will be recorded.

This first project taught me several uses of the programming languages HTML and CSS, to use GitHub and Gitpod, as well as to start my thoughts from the perspective of programming logic.

## User Experience (UX)

-   #### First impressions of the users
    
    1.  As a first time visitor, I could immediately recognize that, it is a podcast about Brazilians abroad due to the name "PodNagringa". 
    2. As a first time visitor, I could easily scroll the one-page website and navigate through its links, being in touch with its simple and objective content, which shows a project of a podcast is to present the project and initiate contacts for the near future. 
    3.  As a first time visitors, I could navigate throughout the site, regardless of screen size.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals
    
    1.  As a returning visitor, I want to get in touch with the podcast's host and could send my message via contact-form present in the link "Get in Touch" of the menu.
    2.  As a returning visitor, want to visit the social media of the podcast, to know more about the launch date of the podcast.
    3.  As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner of the site.
    
-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1.  As a Frequent User, I want to see if there are any updates about the new guests or even write a message to be one of the guests.
    
## Features

### Existing Features
-   __F01 Navigation Bar__
    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all three links of the website, supporting easy navigation.  It includes a Logo, Home page, About and Get in Touch links and is responsive on multiple screen sizes.  On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.

-   __F02 Parallax Image Container__
    - The one-page website has two full-screen images displayed at the first and third containers: one with a setup of a podcast and one of Brandenburger Gate, in Berlin, where de podcast will be running. Both images are scrolling in a parallax effect, bringing a clean and soft impression to the visitors about the project.
    - The third container - the "About" container - presents the ideas and the host of the podcast to the visitors, showing them which expectations they can have with the future project. This container is linked to the link "About" at the main menu.
    - The fourth container - the "Get in Touch" container - presents to the visitors the possible contact forms: a postal code from Berlin, a message contact form and a "call to action" paragraph, inviting people to be in touch and be part of the podcast.
