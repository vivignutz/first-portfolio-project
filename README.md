# PodNagringa Podcast

For the first milestone task with Code Institute, I created a one-page website that features the "NaGringa Podcast", an actual podcast project that will go live later in 2022.

The goal of the website is to present a first impression of the NaGringa Podcast project, informing its mission, who is behind the work, its social networks and also a contact form for potential interested parties.

My motivation for this project was to start the branding process of PodNagringa Podcast, given that it is a real project that is being planned and developed concurrently by me now.

This first project put me in touch with various uses of the programming languages HTML, CSS and also how to use GitHub and Gitpod, as well as thinking about the user's perspective using UX fundamentals. 
Moreover, the whole project helped me to start my thoughts from the programming logic perspective.
